# Until lives remaining is 0 or all letters guessed

  # Elsif guess is not in word, take a life X
# Tell player if they've won or lost

# Can only create a method if required by public interface or it is repeated for the third time.

#Checking the status of the game
# Check if game is over?
  # Game over - Happens if someone has guessed all letters or runs out of lives.
    # Game won if user has guessed all letters, lives greater than 0
    #Game lost if user has not guessed all letters and lives less than 1
  # Game continues when... User still has lives and letters have not all been guessed.
