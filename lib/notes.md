How do I go about passing in a guess word to GameTwo and keep it private?
Will initializing it and then calling it only from a private method work?

Process?
Start creating separate specs for State and Console_UI, then build?

Plan:
1. Create tests to check if:
  a. Game takes a word and initializes it
  b. Word is held within method that is private.
  
2. Create state2_spec
  a. Write tests for state to check it initializes lives_remaining and guesses.

3. Create state2 and initialize variable.

4.
